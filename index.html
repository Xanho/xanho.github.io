<h3>
<a id="degree" class="anchor" href="#degree" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Degree</h3>

<p>The top-level component at Xanho.  A Degree is made up of 3 to 5 Microdegrees.  It typically covers a very wide range of sub-topics.  A Degree takes roughly 4 years to complete.
<em>ex. Computer Science</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="microdegree" class="anchor" href="#microdegree" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Microdegree</h3>

<p>A Microdegree consists of 8 to 12 courses.  Like a Degree, a Microdegree can cover a wide range of sub-topics, but they are more focused than those of a Degree.  A Microdegree takes roughly one year to complete.
<em>ex. Software Programming, Security, Logic</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="course" class="anchor" href="#course" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course</h3>

<p>A Course consists of 1 to 8 units.  It covers a general focus or topic.  A Course takes roughly 10 weeks to complete.
<em>ex. Java, C++, Functional Programming</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="unit" class="anchor" href="#unit" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unit</h3>

<p>A Unit is the lowest level academic building block at Xanho.  It covers a very specific part of a topic.  A Unit can take anywhere from one week to 10 weeks to complete.</p>

<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h2>

<h3>
<a id="students" class="anchor" href="#students" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Students</h3>

<p>The student workflow is as follows:
1. Enroll in a Unit.
2. Study the content provided by the community (typically by teachers or professors).  All tests, quizzes, and assignments are optional.
3. Conduct preliminary independent research using the Xanho Library.
4. Pick an idea for a Research Project which demonstrates understanding of the Unit, and submit for Council approval.
5. Once approved, complete the research project using the media of your choice.
6. Once you have a rough draft, you can optionally submit it for a Peer Review by "graduates" of the Unit.
7. Once you are comfortable with the project, submit for Council approval.
8. If accepted, you become a graduate of the Unit.  If denied, you may make changes or modifications and resubmit.
9. Once you are a graduate of a unit, you gain the ability to Peer Review the projects of students in the Unit.  By Peer Reviewing, you earn free credits to take additional Units.</p>
