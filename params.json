Enroll in a Unit.\r\n2. Study the content provided by the community (typically by teachers or professors).  All tests, quizzes, and assignments are optional.\r\n3. Conduct preliminary independent research using the Xanho Library.\r\n4. Pick an idea for a Research Project which demonstrates understanding of the Unit, and submit for Council approval.\r\n5. Once approved, complete the research project using the media of your choice.\r\n6. Once you have a rough draft, you can optionally submit it for a Peer Review by \"graduates\" of the Unit.\r\n7. Once you are comfortable with the project, submit for Council approval.\r\n8. If accepted, you become a graduate of the Unit.  If denied, you may make changes or modifications and resubmit.\r\n9. Once you are a graduate of a unit, you gain the ability to Peer Review the projects of students in the Unit.  By Peer Reviewing, you earn free credits to take additional Units.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
